# Story

(From Weon Kolalski's diary) 

I was an average guy, working as a recycler at one of the junk recycling facilities of the Rytell Corporation. Everything was boringly routinary until those Rade Blunners of the corporation came to my desk! they told me that I am a Lepricant, not a human! This is so crazy... they stole my precious photos, they are my treasure. And they also tried to kidnap me! But I was able to run away. 

Later, somebody sent me anonymously a message telling me that my photos are in Rytell's main junk recycling facility. 

I have decided to access the facility tonight to get back my photos and escape from this city, but the place is infested with Rade Blunners and Octobots waiting for me!

Rytell's main junk recycling facility is the only place where they recycle the Koight-Vampff machines. For some reason when I am close to them I feel dizzy and I lose my strength. Why...? Anyway, it seems that my anonymous ally is helping me tonight. From time to time I find little origami chiken figures, and when I take them I feel better. I suspect that my anonymous ally is that Agff guy from the Information Security Deparment. He was good at origami!

# The Game

Get rid of the 80 Rade Blunners and Octobots along Rytell's junk recycling facility by jumping over them, while you try to recover your precious 17 photos. Sometimes you will find security doors that require an access card. Fortunately Agff seems to have let some of them here and there for you to take. 

Be careful getting too close to the junk Koight-Vampff machines or you will lose your energy. If you find some Agff's origami chikens take them asap!

When you get rid of all the Rade Blunners and Octobots, go back with your precious photos to the room where you started your quest. Agff will open a secret passage to the bus station for you. You will be able to run away and have a new life.

# How to play the .tap file?

If you do not have an Android TCP/IP device just open the file Rade Blunner Ep1_by_iadvd_2019_classic_ver.tap in your Spectrum emulator (mode 48K) and have fun! If you have a real Spectrum 48K or greater, and you have a .tap loading peripheral, you can load this game too! If you want to use an Android device as a wireless joystick do as follows:

1. Install Fuse ZX Spectrum emulator (use the emulation of the 48K version)  + Spectranet emulator. If Spectranet is correctly installed you will get a local IP for the Spectrum. You will need to verify that the computer is not using a firewall or at least that the port 8081 is open and available to be used for a TCP/IP protocol connection. And of course: if you are the lucky possesor of a real Spectrum 48k machine (or greater version) and a real Spectranet peripheral, then you can also continue to step 2!!

2. Download Rade Blunner Ep1_by_iadvd_2019_Spectranet_AndroidTCPIPVJoystick_ver.tap and load it into Fuse. You will see in the title screen the option 4 (A), which is the Android TCP/IP Virtual Joystick option. If you press 4, the game will wait for you to launch the Android TCP/IP Virtual Joystick application and press its welcome screen OK button. This will make the Virtual Joystick application to connect to the game!. Now you can play normally with your wireless joystick. And again, if you are the lucky possesor of a real Spectrum + Spectranet (not an emulation) then you will need any program able to conver the .tap file into a wav / sound file, so you can load it through the EAR input in the classical way, or if you have a .tap loader device in the expansion port, just copy the .tap file to your peripheral and load it to memory from there. 

Remark: If you want to use the file server available with the Android TCP/IP virtual joystick, follow the instructions in this link (and you can use the radeblunnere1.tap or radeblunnere1A.tap files there, they are the same files with a shorter name, radeblunnere1A.tap is compatible withe the Android TCP/IP Virtual Joystick and the other only uses Keyboard, Kempston or Sinclair emulations):

https://github.com/Iadvd/RetrocomputingZXSpectrum/tree/master/SpectranetTNFS

3. Now launch (if it is not already launched!) your Android TCP/IP Virtual Joystick application. Your Android device must be in the same local network (using WiFi) than the computer where the Fuse emulator is or the ZX Spectrum connected through Spectranet is. The application will ask you the IP that Spectranet is using (or if you do not know it you can write an IP of the same local network to start searching from it).

4. When the Virtual Joystick app. arrives to the IP that is using Spectranet, the game wil detect the joystick and connect to it. The game's Main Menu will appear. 

5. At the main menu, please select option 4 (A = Android TCP/IP Virtual Joystick) and the virtual joystick will be available. The controls are:

      O / joystick left: run left.

      P / joystick right: run right.

      Q, SPACE / joystick fire (Red or Green button): jump.

6. If you close the Android application, the connection is lost. You will need to load again the game and start from step 2.

# For developers: How to compile/reuse the .tap file again? (not required to play the game)

1. In your Z88dk folder (e.g. C:\z88dk10) copy the contents of this folder. You should be using The Mojon Twins adapted version of the compiler (all credits to The Mojon Twins):

https://github.com/mojontwins/MK1

2. If you want to compile the Spectranet+Android TCP/IP Virtual Joystick version, the last line in "config.h" file must be uncommented:

#define ANDROID_TCP_IP			// Spectranet Android TCP/IP Joystick

3. If you want to compile the "classic" (keyboard, Kempston Joystick, Sinclair Joustick only) version, the last line in "config.h" file must commented out:

//#define ANDROID_TCP_IP			// Spectranet Android TCP/IP Joystick

4. Use "make.bat radeblunner" command to create again the .tap file if you wish so.
